## Basic Color Picker with Extended Color Palette

**Project Description:**

This mini project is a web-based color picker application that allows users to select and explore different colors through an interactive interface. The project features a simple yet effective design, providing a user-friendly experience for anyone looking to understand and manipulate colors. The main functionalities include:

Color Picker Input:

A color input element (<input type="color">) allows users to select any color from the color spectrum.
Upon selection, the chosen color is displayed in a square div, showing the color as a background.
Color Information Display:

The hex code, RGB, and HSL values of the selected color are dynamically displayed below the color picker.
Users can copy the hex and RGB values to the clipboard using dedicated buttons.
Predefined Color Palette:

A grid of 19 predefined colors is displayed, each represented by a small square div.
Clicking on any color from the palette updates the color display and shows the corresponding hex, RGB, and HSL values.
Extended Color Palette:

A button is provided to show an extended list of 50 additional colors.
Each color in this extended list displays its hex, RGB, and HSL values, offering a comprehensive palette for users to explore.
Key Features:
Interactive Color Selection:
Users can interactively select colors using the color picker input or by choosing from the predefined palette.

Dynamic Value Conversion:
The application converts hex values to RGB and HSL values in real-time, ensuring that users get immediate feedback on their color choices.

Clipboard Copy Functionality:
Convenient buttons allow users to copy color values (hex and RGB) to the clipboard for easy use in other applications or projects.

Extended Palette Exploration:
An extended list of 50 additional colors provides a broader range of options, each displaying detailed color values (hex, RGB, HSL).

This project is ideal for anyone interested in learning about colors, web development, or simply needing a handy tool to pick and explore colors for design and development purposes.
